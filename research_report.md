# Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and TransE Embeddings for Event Extraction from Email Data

## Abstract

Email communication remains a cornerstone of professional and personal interaction, containing vast amounts of unstructured information about activities, relationships, and events. Extracting structured event information (e.g., meetings, deadlines, collaborations) from email archives is crucial for knowledge management, process analysis, and intelligence gathering. This report details a system designed to parse email data (specifically Gmail Takeout MBOX files) and construct a knowledge graph (KG) representing communication patterns, as implemented in the provided Python codebase. The system utilizes libraries to parse MBOX files and load the structured data into a Neo4j graph database. We then propose the application of knowledge graph embedding techniques, specifically TransE, on the generated graph to facilitate automated event extraction. We describe the system architecture evident in the code, the process of KG construction from emails, the fundamentals of the TransE model, and outline how its learned embeddings can be utilized to identify, complete, and infer event-related information within the email dataset.

## 1. Introduction

The sheer volume of email data generated daily presents both an opportunity and a challenge. While emails contain rich details about events, tasks, and social interactions, this information is largely unstructured and difficult to analyze systematically. Traditional methods often rely on keyword searching or rule-based systems, which can be brittle and struggle with the nuances of natural language.

Knowledge graphs offer a powerful paradigm for representing entities (like people, emails, organizations) and their relationships (such as SENT_TO, REPLIED_TO, MENTIONED) in a structured format. By transforming email archives into a KG, we can explicitly model the communication network and its underlying connections, as demonstrated by the system analyzed in this report which uses Neo4j for this purpose.

This report focuses on this system that first builds an email KG. Subsequently, we explore the potential of applying knowledge graph embedding models, particularly TransE, to this graph. Embeddings learn low-dimensional vector representations of entities and relationships, capturing latent semantic patterns. We propose that these embeddings can be effectively used for event extraction tasks, such as identifying meeting occurrences, tracking project discussions, or discovering implicit collaborations, by analyzing the geometric relationships between entity and relation vectors in the embedding space.

## 2. System Architecture and Knowledge Graph Construction

The foundation of our approach is a Python-based system designed to process email data and load it into a graph database, as implemented in the `main.py` script and associated modules referenced within it. The core logic orchestrates a pipeline integrating several key components.

**2.1 Data Ingestion and Parsing:**
The system accepts email data in the MBOX format, commonly used by services like Google Takeout. As seen in the command-line argument parsing (`argparse`), it can process either a specified single MBOX file (`--mbox` argument) or automatically discover and process all `.mbox` files located in a designated `input/` directory (`--process-all` argument).

*   **Parsing:** The `email_parser.mbox_parser.parse_mbox_to_json` function is responsible for reading the MBOX file(s). It iterates through individual email messages, extracting key metadata and content. While the exact fields extracted depend on the specific `mbox_parser` implementation (details not present in `main.py`), typical information would include Sender, Recipient(s) (To, Cc, Bcc), Date, Subject, Message-ID, In-Reply-To/References (for threading), and potentially the email body.
*   **Serialization:** The extracted information for each email is structured and saved into an intermediate JSON file. The output path can be specified (`--output-json`) or defaults to `parsed_emails.json` (for single file processing) or `<filename>.mbox.json` (when processing multiple files) within the configured output directory (`--output-dir`, defaulting to `output/`). This step decouples parsing from database loading and allows for skipping the parsing phase if valid JSON data already exists (using the `--skip-parsing` flag), as checked in `main.py`.

**2.2 Graph Database Loading:**
The structured JSON data serves as input for populating the knowledge graph.

*   **Graph Model:** A Neo4j graph database is used as the backend, configured via URI, user, and password (`--neo4j-uri`, `--neo4j-user`, `--neo4j-password`, also sourced from environment/`.env` via `config.get_config`). Neo4j is well-suited for this task due to its native graph structure. The `graph_db.loader.EmailGraphLoader.setup_database` method, called within `main.py`, likely defines and creates the necessary schema (node labels like `Person`, `Email`, potentially `Organization`; relationship types like `SENT`, `RECEIVED`, `REPLIED_TO`, `CC_TO`, `BCC_TO`; and constraints or indices).
*   **Loading Process:** The `graph_db.loader.EmailGraphLoader.load_emails_from_json` method reads the JSON file(s) and translates the email data into graph elements. It initializes a connection using `EmailGraphLoader(config['neo4j_uri'], config['neo4j_user'], config['neo4j_password'])` and executes Cypher queries (within the loader class) to create the corresponding nodes and relationships based on the parsed JSON data. Error handling is included within `main.py` to catch exceptions during this process, and the connection is closed (`loader.close()`) upon completion or error.

**2.3 Configuration and Execution:**
The system uses a layered configuration approach (`config.get_config` combined with `argparse`) for flexibility. It allows users to specify input files, output/temporary directories (`--output-dir`, `--temp-dir`), Neo4j connection details, and processing options via environment variables, a `.env` file, or command-line arguments. The `main` function ensures necessary directories (`output_dir`, `temp_dir`) exist (`Path(...).mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)`) and sets up logging (`setup_logging`) based on the configured level (`--log-level`).

**2.4 Agent Interaction (Inferred):**
The codebase imports `agent.agent.EmailGraphAgent` and `main.py` prints instructions on how to run an interactive agent (`python -m agent.interactive`) after successful data loading. This strongly suggests that once the graph is built, an agent component exists to allow users to query, analyze, and interact with the email knowledge graph, likely using Cypher queries or more abstract methods provided by the agent module.

This pipeline effectively transforms raw, semi-structured MBOX email data into a structured Neo4j knowledge graph, laying the groundwork for advanced analysis, including the proposed event extraction using embeddings.

## 3. Event Extraction from Emails

An "event" in the context of email data refers to a specific occurrence or activity that can be inferred from one or more messages and the relationships between them and the involved entities (people, organizations). Extracting these events means identifying not just that an event occurred, but also its type, participants, timing, and other relevant details. Examples pertinent to email analysis include:

*   **Meetings:** Identifying invitations, scheduling discussions, acceptances/declines, meeting follow-ups, and linking participants to the specific meeting instance.
*   **Tasks/Deadlines:** Recognizing task assignments, tracking status updates, identifying deadline reminders, and associating tasks with responsible individuals and relevant projects.
*   **Projects:** Grouping emails related to specific projects, identifying key discussion threads, discovering collaborators, and potentially linking shared documents or resources.
*   **Travel:** Extracting details from itinerary sharing, flight/hotel confirmations, and related logistical communications.
*   **Social Events:** Identifying invitations, coordination efforts, and participant lists for non-work events.

Extracting these events involves identifying relevant emails, participant entities, temporal information (dates/times), potential locations, and classifying the nature of the event itself. The Knowledge Graph constructed by the system described in Section 2 provides a valuable structure for this. For instance, a meeting might be represented by linking participant nodes (`Person`) to an `Email` node (the invitation) via `RECEIVED` relationships, and potentially linking related emails via `REPLIED_TO` or `REFERENCES` relationships within the Neo4j graph. However, manually defining rules or queries to reliably identify these complex, multi-message patterns across a large and diverse email dataset is challenging and often incomplete. This motivates the exploration of automated methods like knowledge graph embeddings to uncover these event patterns more effectively.

## 4. TransE for Knowledge Graph Embeddings

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques aim to represent entities and relationships, which form the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph, as dense, low-dimensional vectors (embeddings) in a continuous vector space. This allows for mathematical operations on graph components, enabling tasks like similarity calculation, pattern detection, and link prediction. TransE (Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data) is a foundational and influential translational embedding model known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

**Core Idea:** The central concept behind TransE is to model relationships as translation operations in the embedding space. For a given triple (or fact) present in the knowledge graph, represented as (head entity `h`, relationship `r`, tail entity `t`), the model learns vector embeddings for each element: **h**, **r**, and **t**. The objective is that the embedding of the head entity (**h**) plus the vector representing the relationship (**r**) should be geometrically close to the embedding of the tail entity (**t**). Mathematically:

\[ \mathbf{h} + \mathbf{r} \approx \mathbf{t} \]

This implies that the relationship vector **r** represents the translation from the head entity's position to the tail entity's position in the embedding space.

**Learning Process:** TransE embeddings are typically learned through optimization using a margin-based ranking loss function. The training process involves sampling valid triples `(h, r, t)` from the knowledge graph and, for each valid triple, generating corrupted or negative triples `(h', r, t')`. A corrupted triple is created by replacing either the head `h` or the tail `t` with a randomly chosen entity from the graph (e.g., `(h', r, t)` or `(h, r, t')`).

The loss function aims to minimize the "energy" or distance score for valid triples while maximizing it for corrupted triples, ensuring a margin `γ` between them. A common energy function is the L1 or L2 norm of the translation error: \( ||\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{t}|| \). The ranking loss encourages:

\[ ||\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{t}|| + \gamma < ||\mathbf{h'} + \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{t'}|| \]

By minimizing this loss over the entire graph data, the model learns embeddings **h**, **r**, and **t** that capture the relational structure inherent in the knowledge graph. Entities involved in similar relationships or contexts tend to have embeddings located closer together in the vector space.

## 5. Applying TransE for Event Extraction on the Email KG

Once the email knowledge graph is constructed using the system described in Section 2 (parsing MBOX files and loading into Neo4j), the TransE model can be trained on this graph data. The training process involves extracting the triples (head entity, relationship, tail entity) representing the email communications (e.g., `(person_A, SENT, email_1)`, `(email_1, RECEIVED, person_B)`, `(email_2, REPLIED_TO, email_1)`) from Neo4j and feeding them into a KGE training framework. The resulting learned embeddings for entities (`Person`, `Email` nodes) and relationships (`SENT`, `RECEIVED`, etc.) can then be leveraged for various event extraction tasks:

**5.1 Representing Event Types:**
While the initial graph constructed by the `main.py` pipeline focuses on direct email interactions (send, receive, reply), event extraction requires identifying higher-level concepts.
*   **Implicit Representation:** Embeddings might implicitly capture event-related semantics. For example, emails that are part of a meeting scheduling thread might cluster together in the embedding space due to shared participants and reply structures.
*   **Explicit Representation:** We could augment the graph *before* training TransE by adding specific event nodes (e.g., a `Meeting` node) and relationships (e.g., `PARTICIPATED_IN`, `SCHEDULED_BY`). Alternatively, new relationship types representing event semantics could be inferred or added heuristically (e.g., identifying an email as `IS_INVITATION` based on keywords). TransE could then learn embeddings for these explicit event-related components if sufficient examples exist.

**5.2 Link Prediction for Event Completion:**
TransE's ability to predict missing links (`h + r ≈ ?` or `? + r ≈ t`) is valuable for completing partial event information.
*   **Identifying Participants:** Given an email identified as a meeting invitation (`email_invite`), we could use the learned embeddings to find potential participants (`p`) by searching for entities whose embeddings `**p**` satisfy `**email_invite** + **RECEIVED** ≈ **p**` (i.e., minimize `||**email_invite** + **RECEIVED** - **p**||`). This could uncover participants missed during initial parsing or not explicitly listed in the 'To'/'Cc' fields.
*   **Connecting Related Emails:** Identify emails `e2` that are likely part of the same event discussion as email `e1` by checking the plausibility (low distance score) of triples like `(e1, REPLIED_TO, e2)` or even a more abstract `(e1, RELATED_TO_EVENT, e2)` if such a relation embedding could be learned or estimated.

**5.3 Triple Classification for Event Identification:**
We can use the TransE scoring function (`||**h** + **r** - **t**||`) to assess the likelihood of a specific event-related fact (triple).
*   **Event Verification:** Given a candidate triple like `(person_A, PARTICIPATED_IN, meeting_X)` or `(email_Y, IS_INVITATION_FOR, event_Z)`, its score according to the trained model indicates its plausibility. Scores below a determined threshold could confirm the event fact. This requires having embeddings for event nodes/relations.
*   **Identifying Event Type:** If multiple event-related relationships exist (e.g., `IS_MEETING_INVITE`, `IS_TASK_ASSIGNMENT`), the relationship `r` that minimizes the score `||**email_X** + **r** - **relevant_entity_Y**||` could suggest the most likely event type associated with `email_X`.

**5.4 Entity/Email Clustering:**
Since embeddings capture semantic similarity, nodes involved in similar activities or discussions should have embeddings located close to each other.
*   **Event Grouping:** Applying clustering algorithms (like k-means or DBSCAN) to the embeddings of `Email` nodes could automatically group emails related to the same event (e.g., all emails discussing a specific project or coordinating a particular meeting). Clustering `Person` embeddings might reveal groups of individuals who frequently collaborate or participate in the same types of events.

**5.5 Querying for Event Patterns:**
Vector arithmetic in the embedding space allows for analogical reasoning and pattern querying.
*   **Finding Similar Events:** Find emails or entities related to a known event instance. For example, find emails `e_new` such that `**e_new** ≈ **known_meeting_invite**`.
*   **Complex Queries:** Potentially search for entities `x` satisfying patterns like `**(person_A)** + **SENT** ≈ **x**` where `**x**` is also "close" to a conceptual vector representing "meeting invitations" (perhaps derived by averaging embeddings of known invitation emails).

**Implementation Considerations:** To apply TransE, the graph data (triples) must be extracted from Neo4j. Libraries like AmpliGraph, PyKEEN, or TensorFlow/PyTorch-based KGE implementations can then be used to train the TransE model. The learned embeddings would subsequently be loaded back or used alongside the graph database for the downstream event extraction tasks detailed above, possibly integrated into the `agent` component mentioned in the codebase.

## 6. Discussion

The approach of constructing an email knowledge graph using the described system and subsequently applying TransE embeddings offers a promising direction for automated event extraction from communication data. This combination leverages the strengths of both structured graph representations and data-driven embedding techniques.

**Advantages:**
*   **Structured Foundation:** The knowledge graph, built by processing MBOX files into Neo4j as shown in the codebase, provides an explicit, queryable structure representing communication entities (people, emails) and their direct relationships (sending, receiving, replying). This is a significant improvement over analyzing raw text alone.
*   **Discovery of Latent Patterns:** KGE models like TransE excel at uncovering non-obvious, latent patterns and similarities within the graph structure. These patterns, represented by the proximity and orientation of vectors in the embedding space, can signify complex relationships indicative of events that are hard to define with explicit rules or simple graph queries.
*   **Inferential Capabilities:** TransE's translational property enables inferential tasks like link prediction (finding missing participants or related emails) and assessing the plausibility of potential event-related facts (triple classification). This allows the system to go beyond directly observed connections.
*   **Data-Driven Approach:** The embeddings are learned directly from the patterns present in the user's specific email data, potentially adapting better to the nuances of that dataset compared to generic, pre-defined rules.

**Challenges and Limitations:**
*   **Graph Sparsity and Cold Start:** Email communication graphs, especially for individuals or smaller datasets, can be sparse. This sparsity might make it challenging for embedding models to learn rich and robust representations, particularly for entities or relationships with few connections. New entities (e.g., a person appearing in only one email) pose a "cold start" problem for learning meaningful embeddings.
*   **Defining and Representing Events:** The primary challenge lies in bridging the gap between low-level communication relationships (`SENT`, `RECEIVED`) captured in the initial KG and higher-level event concepts (`Meeting`, `Task Assignment`). Simply training TransE on the basic communication graph might not directly yield embeddings suitable for identifying complex events without further steps like graph augmentation (adding event nodes/relations), incorporating content features, or designing specific downstream tasks that interpret the embeddings.
*   **Scalability:** While the provided codebase handles parsing and loading, training KGE models on extremely large graphs (millions of emails, hundreds of thousands of entities) can become computationally expensive, requiring significant memory and processing time, potentially necessitating distributed training approaches.
*   **TransE Model Limitations:** TransE, while effective, has known limitations. It struggles to accurately model symmetric relationships (if `(h, r, t)` is true, `(t, r, h)` should also be true, which `h + r ≈ t` doesn't naturally enforce) and has difficulty with 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relationship patterns (e.g., one email sent to many recipients). An email sent to many people might result in the `SENT` relation pulling the email embedding in multiple conflicting directions.
*   **Evaluation:** Evaluating the effectiveness of event extraction based on embeddings can be complex, often requiring manually labeled event data for comparison, which is time-consuming to create.

**Future Work:**
Addressing these challenges points towards several avenues for future research and development:
*   **Richer Graph Schema:** Enhance the initial KG schema within the `graph_db.loader` to include nodes and relationships more closely related to events, possibly by integrating simple NLP techniques during parsing (e.g., identifying meeting keywords, extracting date/time mentions) to add richer properties or preliminary event tags.
*   **Advanced KGE Models:** Explore more sophisticated KGE models beyond TransE (e.g., TransH, RotatE, ComplEx, DistMult) that are better equipped to handle complex relational patterns, including 1-to-N relations common in email.
*   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine embedding-based methods with rule-based systems or NLP analysis of email content. Embeddings could suggest potential events or related entities, which are then verified or refined using content analysis.
*   **Temporal Embeddings:** Incorporate temporal information (email timestamps) more directly into the embedding process, as event understanding is often time-dependent. Temporal knowledge graph embedding models could be investigated.
*   **Downstream Task Models:** Develop specific models (e.g., graph neural networks, classifiers) that take the learned TransE embeddings as input features to perform fine-grained event classification and extraction of event parameters (participants, time, location).

## 7. Conclusion

This report detailed a systematic approach for leveraging email data, specifically MBOX archives, for event extraction, centered around the construction of a knowledge graph and the application of TransE embeddings. We analyzed a Python-based system (`main.py` and associated modules) that effectively parses MBOX files, extracts relevant communication metadata, and structures this information within a Neo4j graph database, creating a knowledge graph of email interactions.

Building upon this structured representation, we proposed the use of the TransE knowledge graph embedding model. By training TransE on the triples extracted from the email KG, we can learn low-dimensional vector representations for entities (people, emails) and relationships (sent, received, replied_to). These embeddings capture latent structural and semantic patterns within the communication network.

We outlined several ways these learned embeddings can facilitate automated event extraction: identifying event types, completing partial event information via link prediction, verifying event facts through triple classification, grouping related emails/entities using clustering, and enabling novel querying based on vector similarity.

While acknowledging challenges such as data sparsity, the need for effective event representation within the graph, and the limitations of the TransE model itself, the combination of a well-constructed knowledge graph and KGE techniques presents a powerful, data-driven methodology. It moves beyond traditional rule-based or keyword-search methods to uncover complex event patterns embedded within email communication archives. Future work focusing on richer graph schemas, more advanced embedding models, and hybrid approaches integrating NLP holds significant potential for further enhancing the accuracy and scope of event extraction from email data using this KG-based framework.
