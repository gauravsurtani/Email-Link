# Step 1: Define Problem & Scope

## Goal

Demonstrate the ability to extract, connect, and query semantic information from emails using a knowledge graph and GenAI/agentic systems.

## Use Cases (Demo Questions)

1. **Job Applications**
   - "How many jobs did I apply to at Walmart?"
   - "List all companies I applied to in 2024."
2. **Financial Tracking**
   - "What's my total credit card debt?"
   - "Show all my recent bank statement balances."
3. **Travel Organization**
   - "Show all my travel bookings in 2024."
   - "List all flights and hotels booked for June 2024."
4. **Purchases & Receipts**
   - "Summarize my Amazon purchases in the last 6 months."
   - "How much did I spend on electronics in 2024?"
5. **General Entity Search**
   - "Show all emails mentioning 'Stanford University'."
   - "List all emails related to 'project X'."

## Success Criteria

- The system can answer the above questions by traversing a semantic graph built from real or synthetic emails.
- Answers are generated by combining information from multiple emails when necessary.
- The process is automated using GenAI and/or agentic systems for extraction and querying.

## Next Actions

- [ ] Finalize 3–5 target queries for the demo (choose from above or add new ones).
- [ ] Gather or generate a small, diverse set of sample emails for each use case (10–50 per use case).
- [ ] Document the sample queries and the expected answer format for each.
- [ ] Review with project partners or instructor for feedback before proceeding to data collection.
