Why Email Data?
"Why should it be so hard to find something on email? We have chatbots for everything but this?"
Vast Unstructured Information
Emails contain rich details about events, tasks, and social interactions.
Hard to Analyze Systematically
Traditional methods rely on brittle keyword searching or rule-based systems.
Knowledge Graph Solution
Represents entities and relationships in structured format for analysis.
Tracking Event
Currently Gmail only provides Promotions & Social Labels.

System Architecture
Data Ingestion
Process MBOX format email data from Google Takeout
Parsing & Serialization
Extract metadata and content, from MBOX to Graph format
Graph Database Loading
Populate Neo4j with nodes (Person, Email) and relationships
Embedding Generation
Convert tuples of 'From' , 'To' and 'Event' nodes to embeddings
Agent Interaction
Query, analyze, and interact with the email knowledge graph

What Are We Extracting?
Meetings
Invitations, scheduling discussions, acceptances/declines, follow-ups, and participants.
Tasks & Deadlines
Assignments, status updates, reminders, responsible individuals, and projects.
Projects
Related email threads, key discussions, collaborators, and shared resources.
Travel & Social Events
Itineraries, confirmations, invitations, and coordination efforts.

Database Schema
Focus Area
Why it’s on the diagram
1. Email = Hub
Central node connects to every other entity.
2. Person ← → Email edges (SENT, RECEIVED, BCC, COPIED)
Encode how each person touched the message.
3. Thread & Reply loop (BELONGS_TO, REPLY_TO)
Reconstructs conversation trees.
4. Context nodes (Label, Attachment, Domain)
Add metadata richness.
5. Event → Location path
Extracts meetings and where they happen.
6. Graph extensibility
New nodes/edges can be added pain-free.

TransE: Translating Embeddings from Knowledge Graphs
Core Concept
TransE models relationships as translation operations in the embedding space.
For a triple (head entity h, relationship r, tail entity t):
h + r ≈ t
Learning Process
TransE uses a margin-based ranking loss function.
It minimizes the "energy" for valid triples.
And maximizes the energy for corrupted (negative) triples.

How exactly does Trans E work for  us?
Setup
Create a KG Triples dataset
Head, Relation, Tail of the complete graph
Setup model parameters, 
Training
Set Epochs
Each epoch over batches of (h, r, t) 
Calculate score over original data
Then generates negative / corrupted triples by replacing entities.
Computes the loss using Trans-E loss method
Loss Minimization
After each epoch,  loss function aims to increase the score of positive samples more than the negative scores.
Then performs Backpropagation to recalculate gradients
Normalization
On each loss function update, it also updates the embeddings of the model.
Essentially, it normalizes the entity embeddings so that vector lengths don't overgrow, which is a known issue of TransE.
Logging Average loss for each epoch.

Use Cases of adding Trans-E to Email KG
Event Identification 
Classify email types and discover patterns - Is there an interview?
Link Prediction 
Event information - Who is the interviewer? Where to meet?
Participant Discovery 
Find missing event participants - Who are the other people involved in the interviewer, recruiter? Identifying helpful people?
Email Clustering 
Group related communications - Other than Social , Promotions, we can have Flight Update, Meetings Tags.

Evaluation of TransE
Link Prediction Performance

With an MRR of 0.564, our model ranks the correct email recipient fairly high on average.
A Hits@10 score of 65% confirms that in most cases, the true recipient appears among the top 10 predictions — a strong result given the noise in email networks.
Most true links appear in the top 10–20 ranks, with a long tail of harder predictions.
The average rank of 24.1 shows that our predictions are not only accurate but also confidently placed near the top.

For AUC of 0.87, the TransE-based model performs significantly better than random — this indicates that our learned embeddings are capturing meaningful structural information about email communication.
This separation validates that TransE embeddings capture latent semantic relationships in email communication, making it suitable for link prediction tasks.
